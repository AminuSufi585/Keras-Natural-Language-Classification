# Spam Classification via Neural Networks in Keras

Welcome! In this workshop, you're going to learn about how you can classify natural language sentences via Neural Networks, all coded in the Keras library (Python 2.7).

During the course of this workshop, we'll go through the following steps:

1. I'll teach you: How Neural Networks work, and how Neural Networks can be applied to NLC.
2. We'll understand the problem at hand.
3. Take a look at some of the solutions presented by earlier works.
4. Understand how we can implement the system.
5. Implement a simple CNN based system.
6. Test the system.
7. Implement an advanced RNN based system.
8. Test the system.
